# RacketProgramming

> author: [Tangqi Feng](https://tangqifeng.github.io/)

These are solutions to the [Racket programming tasks](https://github.com/TangqiFeng/Racket-Programming/blob/brench-for-upload-file/tasks.pdf)

> Module: THEORY OF ALGORITHMS / 4th Year  
> Lecturer: Dr [Ian McLoughlin](https://ianmcloughlin.github.io/)

These tasks is completed in the [Racket programming language](https://racket-lang.org/) and follows “from scratch”, which means using only cons, car, cdr, define, lambda, if, null, null?, cond, map, = and the basic numerical operators (+, -, *, /, modulo).

## How this repository is organised

* folder(.vscode) conrains 'tasks.json', which is a tool for 'VS Code' to execute the racket code. (for example, type 'CRTL + B' to run the code automatically)

* there ate 10 .rkt files, which is the sulutions matchs [Racket programming tasks](https://github.com/TangqiFeng/Racket-Programming/blob/brench-for-upload-file/tasks.pdf) one by one.

  It named like: NO-Name.rkt --> 'No' is the task number, 'Name' is the main function name of such task.
  
## How to clone this repository
* Go to the [GitHub](https://www.github.com) [repository page](https://github.com/TangqiFeng/MINIST-Data-Problem-Sheet).
* Find the link to clone the repository.
### or
* just download the zip file

## How to run these scripts
go to the repository folder, open the command-line interpreter or terminal(mac), 

type  ``` $ racket + title.rkt``` 

(title is the name of the file you wnat to execute)

OR you can run by using other tools: [DrRacket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/drracket/index.html), [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

## racket is needed, [download](https://download.racket-lang.org/)

> On Windows, you can start DrRacket from the Racket entry in the Start menu. In Windows Vista or newer, you can just type DrRacket. You can also run it from its folder, which you can find in Program Files → Racket → DrRacket.

> On Mac OS, double click on the DrRacket icon. It is probably in a Racket folder that you dragged into your Applications folder. If you want to use command-line tools, instead, Racket executables are in the "bin" directory of the Racket folder (and if you want to set your PATH environment variable, you’ll need to do that manually).

> On Unix (including Linux), the drracket executable can be run directly from the command-line if it is in your path, which is probably the case if you chose a Unix-style distribution when installing. Otherwise, navigate to the directory where the Racket distribution is installed, and the drracket executable will be in the "bin" subdirectory.
